 ## Description

_Welcome to Tech News API. In this project I followed along with 2U/Trilogy Educations Continuation course-Java for Javascript Developers. I did not write any original code in this assignment, followed along step by step to learn Java, Springboot, Thymeleaf._

This application:
* is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://cc-java-api-55.herokuapp.com/ "Link to deployed page") 
* is having some issues with comments at the moment.
* Users are able to sign up, login, logout and create a post.
